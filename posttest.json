      "question": "Among the butane conformers, when viewed about C 2 -C 3 bond, which occur at energy minima on a graph of potential energy versus dihedral angle?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Gauche only",
        "b": "anti",
        "c": "syn",
        "d": "Both gauche and syn"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Gauche conformers will have higher energy than anti conformer.",
        "b": "Anti conformers have both CH3 groups farthest apart and hence has lowest energy.",
        "c": "Syn conformers have the most close CH3 groups and this will lead to highest energy peaks.",
        "d": "Only the anti conformer has the lowest energy."

      "question": "The correct statement regarding conformation in butane is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The two gauche forms, when viewed about C 2 - C 3 bond, are enantiomer",
        "b": "There is greater barrier to rotation about C 1 — C 2 bond than to C 2 - C 3 bond",
        "c": "Its gauche form has higher energy than an eclipsed form when CH 3 — and 'H' are eclipsing",
        "d": "In the most stable conformer, dihedral angle between hydrogen atoms is only 90°"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The two gauche forms are mirror images of each other but are non superimposable.",
        "b": "The C1-C2 bond will have a lower barrier to rotation as only H atoms will be present on C1 to interact with the CH2CH3 atoms on C2.",
        "c": "Gauche form does not have higher form than any of the eclipsed forms.",
        "d": "In the most stable anti conformer, H atoms make an angle of 60°"

      "question": "Select the correct statement concerning conformers of ethane and hexachloroethane:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Both have different same number of important conformers",
        "b": "Potential energy versus dihedral angle curves have similar nature in both cases",
        "c": "Least stable conformer is hexachloroethane is most polar",
        "d": "In potential energy versus dihedral angle diagram, there is greater difference between maxima and minima in ethane than in hexachloroethane"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Both will have the same nature of important conformer as all H are now replaced by Cl.",
        "b": "Since all H atoms are changed at the same time, the nature of the curves will remain the same.",
        "c": "None of the conformers in will be polar.",
        "d": "The energy difference between maxima and minima will be greater for hexachloroethane than ethane as the larger Chlorine atoms will interact more among themselves than smaller H atoms."

        "a": "The structure has 6 C atoms and hence is not of pentane.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Skew boat conformation is the same as gauche conformation and will have the dihedral angle of 60 between the CH3 groups.",
        "b": "Eclipsed conformer will have dihedral angle of 0 between the CH3 groups leading to maximum energy.",
        "c": "Gauche will have dihedral angle of 60 between the CH3 groups.",
