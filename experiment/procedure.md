1. Select the molecule under study and view the z-matrix for the molecule.
2. The gamess input file will be displayed with the required options like RUNTYP=RSURFACE, IFZMAT=3,7,4,1,8 for the conformational search along the Cl-C-C-Cl dihedral (denoted by 7, 4, 1, 8 atoms in the molecule) angle.
3. Upon clicking rungamess the output file for the same would be generated which contains the energy at each specified dihedral angle.
4. The energy thus generated is in Hartrees. Next slide contains a table where the energy values at the specified dihedrals are to be filled in kcal/mol.
5. By taking these energy and dihedral values, the plot for the energy Vs dihedral looks as shown in the next slide.
6. Upon clicking on the plot at various dihedrals, the conformation at that particular dihedral is being displayed.
7. All the conformations for the analysis are being played alongside of the graph to show the various possible conformations.
